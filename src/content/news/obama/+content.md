They're deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns - this too widens the racial divide, and blocks the path to understanding. The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically-elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all our troops from Iraq by 2012. And fault lines must be closed among Muslims as well, as the divisions between Sunni and Shia have led to tragic violence, particularly in Iraq.

It wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma. I get it. And so in that spirit, let me speak as clearly and plainly as I can about some specific issues that I believe we must finally confront together.

John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. "If you're organizing churches," they said, "it might be helpful if you went to church once in a while." And I thought, "Well, I guess that makes sense." In fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community.

When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and changing communities.

There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. In South Carolina, where the Confederate Flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans.

But it also comes from my own American story. The man I met more than twenty years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith, a man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another; to care for the sick and lift up the poor. And yet Al Qaeda chose to ruthlessly murder these people, claimed credit for the attack, and even now states their determination to kill on a massive scale. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. Around the world, we can turn dialogue into Interfaith service, so bridges between peoples lead to action - whether it is combating malaria in Africa, or providing relief after a natural disaster.

They are anxious about their futures, and feel their dreams slipping away; in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country.

More work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Ill., who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that's moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long road toward nothingness. They all have different stories and reasons. Now let me be clear: issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam.

That has been my experience at Trinity. Some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that's when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom. And when the first Muslim-American was recently elected to Congress, he took the oath to defend our Constitution using the same Holy Koran that one of our Founding Fathers - Thomas Jefferson - kept in his personal library. Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.

I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. It is that fundamental belief, it is that fundamental belief, I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper that makes this country work. And so this will be a difficult debate next week. He contains within him the contradictions - the good and the bad - of the community that he has served diligently for so many years. But it should be their choice. The people of the world can live together in peace.

Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.
